# Users Data app

This app is done to understand how useReducer works.

1. Build Add user form.
2. form with Validation.
3. can't register with same email address functionality
4. displayed users in a table format
5. Added functionality to user table: disable and enable user account
6. For state management, used useReducer and one custom hook which manages all the states and dispatchers

## Note:

1. data is not stored in any DB or localstorage
2. if we refresh the page data will be removed or erased
