# Users Data app

This app is done to understand how useReducer works.

1. Build Add user form.
2. displayed users in a table format
3. Added functionality to user table: disable and enable user account
4. For state management, used useReducer and one custom hook which manages all the states and dispatchers

## Note:

1. data is not stored in any DB or localstorage
2. if we refresh the page data will be removed or erased
