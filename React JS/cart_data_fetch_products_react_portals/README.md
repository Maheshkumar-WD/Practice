# Cart Page

### Problem Statement:
1. display products data on initial load (as cards) with add to cart icon 
2. on clicking the product should add to cart.
3. use useState hook to manage state.
4. build nav bar which contains only cart icon with total cart quantity.
5. on clicking cart icon, model should be open. list all products in that model. along with total amount and total price.
6. increase and decrease functionality should work.
7. closing cart also should work
8. use any css library (chakra UI / material UI / tailwind CSS)anyone.


## Note 
1. This Cart Page is done to understand how useEffect works and how cart functionality works
2. Data is not stored in db (Database) or in localstorage. It is just stored in useState, if you refresh the page data will be removed.
